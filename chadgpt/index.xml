      <description>John was an intrepid and ambitious young man at the outset of his 20&amp;rsquo;s. His head was filled with ideas that had been motivated greatly by the words of the famous thinkers like Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein, who both engaged in a passionate disagreement as to indeterminacy in quantum mechanics. As he grew older, the thought of mortality began to haunt him; it made his skin crawl, so he sought solace in the warmth of the scientific world where he could observe and admire the universe and its many marvels and intricacies.</description>

      <description>My name is Septimus and I was born on a particularly starless night. Progeny of a family of literary geniuses and musicians, I sought refuge in poetry as a means of escape. As I grew, the way the white paper would be filled with the colors of my unending musings, I grew to love the art of poetry and writing. It was then I went to college, my colleagues and I, having high expectations of ourselves.</description>

      <description>Once there lived a mother with a child, Whose name be unknown yet vitally mild, The innocence of the child was stellar, His beautiful smile brought beauty to her.
Every morning was a joy of her living, Seeing joy and mirth his smile was giving, But fate had something else to give, Unknown to the mother, his life to relive.
When the child grew, his mind was spun, Finding himself amongst the capitalistic pun, Was it a sin or a life just set?</description>

      <description>Chatgpt is a natural language processing chatbot that is quite nifty. Here are a few works that I made using chadgpt. Most works of chatgpt may come off as very vague or &amp;ldquo;non-human&amp;rdquo;, but those results are the consequence of poor prompts. One has to provide some degree of context and other paramters that&amp;rsquo;d let the nlp bot give you what you want. For example, if I wanted Chatgpt to generate a poem in Chaucer&amp;rsquo;s English or in a style that reflects Dostoevesky&amp;rsquo;s, I should specify so.</description>
