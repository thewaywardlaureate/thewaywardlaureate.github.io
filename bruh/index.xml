      <description>The words I use, intentionally or unintentionally, have their own meanings, which cease to exist when I place them with other words. Does the meaning of a sentence so formed have the same meaning as the summation of the individual meanings of its constituent words? All sentences can have multiple meanings when read by multiple people. Where exactly does my intention get lost in a sentence and from where do personal inferences begin?</description>

      <description>You were the puff I couldn&amp;rsquo;t exhale.
Even when my alveoli threatened to burn
and my breathing became fatally frail,
about you, I remained foolishly stubborn.
No sun could light my world.
No thunder could instill fear.
And then , emotions unfurled,
when, to you, I happened near.
Melody and noise was the same.
I was blind to poetry&amp;rsquo;s glow.
And then you lit in me a flame.
I submitted to the ethereal flow.</description>

      <description>I want to die
When I think of death, I hear silence. Unlike the rough bustle of the living, this silence carriers tenderness. Unlike the blinding lights of mankind, death arrives with cool darkness. When I think of death, I remember the janitors from my school cleaning the blackboards fastidiously with maladorous grey-green rag clothes. Unlike a duster, the rag cloth would clean it black, in a manner that&amp;rsquo;d quench my visual thirst.</description>

      <description>Welcome,oh adventurer, to this place that exists between what is going to happen and what has happened. It has no tethers with the present, the past and the future. It exists at the threshold. Somewhere where something inexplicable occurs. Remain where you are. Savour this freedom from time. No future to worry about, no past to cry over and no present spent in confusion.
Embrace this change.
